                <h1>Job opportunitys </h1>
                <p>There’s no universal definition of “data scientist” or “data analyst” that every company agrees on, so different positions with the same title may require different skill sets. Obviously, we can’t cover every potential job title that might
                    be used by a company, but we can talk about some of the major roles in the data science universe, how they differ, and the progression of your career in the field if you’re starting out in that role. Note: below, we’re using average
                    salary data from Indeed for each position, based on U.S. data. Obviously, salaries will vary by location, company, and based on your own skill set and experience level, so it’s probably best to treat these numbers as rough guidelines.

            <h1>Data Scientist </h1>
            <p>What is a data scientist? Data scientists do many of the same things as data analysts, but they also typically build machine learning models to make accurate predictions about the future based on past data. A data scientist often has more
                freedom to pursue their own ideas and experiment to find interesting patterns and trends in the data that management may not have thought about. As a data scientist, you might be asked to assess how a change in marketing strategy could
                affect your company’s bottom line. This would entail a lot of data analysis work (acquiring, cleaning, and visualizing data), but it would also probably require building and training a machine learning model that can make reliable future
                predictions based on past data. Career prospects: If you’re working as a data scientist, your next job title may well be senior data scientist, a position that’ll earn you about $20,000 more per year on average. You might also choose to
                specialize further in machine learning as a machine learning engineer, which would also bring a pay raise. Or, you can look more toward management with roles like lead data scientist. If you want to maximize earnings, your ultimate goal
                might be a C-suite role in data — such as chief data officer — although these roles require management skills and may not involve a lot of actual day-to-day work with data. Average salary: $121,674 (plus stock options) </p>

        <div class="contentBox">
            <h1>Data Analyst </h1>
            <p>What is a data analyst? This is typically considered an “entry-level” position in the data science field, although not all data analysts are junior and salaries can range widely. A data analyst’s primary job is to look at company or industry
                data and use it to answer business questions, then communicate those answers to other teams in the company to be acted upon.  Data analyst is a broad term that encompasses a wide variety of positions, so your career path is fairly open-ended.
                One common next step is to continue building your data science skills — often with a focus on machine learning — and work toward a role as a data scientist. Alternatively, if you’re more interested in software development, data infrastructure,
                and helping build a complete data pipeline, you could work toward a position as a data engineer. Average salary: $75,068 (plus an average $2,500 yearly cash bonus)

        <div class="contentBox">
            <h1>Data Engineer </h1>
            <p>What is a data engineer? A data engineer manages a company’s data infrastructure. Their job requires a lot less statistical analysis and a lot more software development and programming skill. At a company with a data team, the data engineer
                might be responsible for building data pipelines to get the latest sales, marketing, and revenue data to data analysts and scientists quickly and in a usable format. They’re also likely responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure
                needed to store and quickly access past data. Career prospects: Data engineers can move into more senior engineering positions through continued experience, or use their skills to transition into a variety of other software development
                specialties. Outside of specialization, there is also the potential to move into management roles, either as the leader of an engineering or data team (or both, although only very large companies are likely to have a sizable data engineering
                team). Average salary: $129,609 (plus an average $5,000 yearly cash bonus)
