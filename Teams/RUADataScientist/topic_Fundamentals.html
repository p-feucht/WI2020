            <h1>Programming </h1>
            <p> As a Data Scientist you must know the basic of programming. For that you should have some knowledge in a basic language like Java or C. Also some skills in Html, CSS, Java Script and PHP are nice to have to develop am own website if needed.
                But the <b> most important programming language to know as a Data Scientist is Python or R </b>. Both languages are used to develop machine learning algorithms, analyse data or visualize data. How you can see in the picture, SQL is the
                most used language as a Data Scientist. SQL is necessary to sort, collect and connect Data. SQL is a MUST-HAVE in the Data Science world like Python or R. </p>
