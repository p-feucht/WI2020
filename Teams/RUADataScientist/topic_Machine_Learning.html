                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training
                    data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult
                    or infeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks. <br><br> A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine
                    learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis
                    through unsupervised learning. In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.
