                <h1>Overview </h1>
                <p>Data scientists have changed almost every industry. In medicine, their algorithms help predict patient side effects. In sports, their models and metrics have redefined “athletic potential.” Data science has even tackled traffic, with route-optimizing
                    models that capture typical rush hours and weekend lulls. <br> <br> Data science shouldn’t be confused with data analytics. Both fields are ways of understanding big data, and both often involve analyzing massive databases using R
                    and Python. These points of overlap mean the fields are often treated as one field, but they differ in important ways.
                    <br> <br>For one, they have different relationships with time. Data analysts synthesize big data to answer concrete questions grounded in the past, e.g., “How has our subscriber base grown from 2016 to 2019?” In other words, they mine
                    big data for insights on what’s already happened. Meanwhile, data scientists build on big data, creating models that can predict or analyze whatever comes next.

            <h1>Examples</h1>
            <p>
                <b> HEALTH CARE</b> <br> <br> Back in 2008, data science made its first major mark on the health care industry. Google staffers discovered they could map flu outbreaks in real time by tracking location data on flu-related searches. The
                CDC's existing maps of documented flu cases, FluView, was updated only once a week. Google quickly rolled out a competing tool with more frequent updates: Google Flu Trends. <br> <br> But it didn’t work. In 2013, Google estimated about
                twice the flu cases that were actually observed. The tool’s secret methodology seemed to involve finding correlations between search term volume and flu cases. That meant the Flu Trends algorithm sometimes put too much stock in seasonal
                search terms like “high school basketball.” <br> <br>

                <b> ROAD TRAVEL</b> <br> <br> Driving plays a central role in American life. The Supreme Court has called it “a virtual necessity,” and the vast majority of Americans — 86 percent — own or lease cars. In 2018, American automobiles burned
                more than 140 billion gallons of gasoline. In short, we love to drive. Unfortunately, this habit contributes to climate change. That’s where data science comes in. <br> <br> While both biking and public transit can curb driving-related
                emissions, data science can do the same by optimizing road routes. And though data-driven route adjustments are often small, they can help save thousands of gallons of gas when spread across hundreds of trips and vehicles — even among
                companies that aren’t explicitly eco-focused. <br> <br>

                <b>SPORTS </b> <br> <br> In the early 2000s, the Oakland Athletics’ recruitment budget was so small the team couldn’t recruit quality players. At least, they couldn’t recruit players any other teams considered quality. So the general manager
                redefined quality, using in-game statistics other teams ignored to predict player potential and assemble a strong team on the cheap. <br> <br> His strategy helped the A’s make the playoffs, and it snowballed from there. Author Michael
                Lewis wrote a book about the phenomenon, Moneyball, which spawned a film by the same name starring Brad Pitt. Today, there’s a $4.5-million global market for sports analytics.<br> <br>

                <b>GOVERNMENT  </b> <br> <br> Though few think of the U.S. government as “extremely online,” its agencies can access more data than Google and Facebook combined. Not only do its agencies maintain their own databases of ID photos, fingerprints
                and phone activity, government agents can get warrants to obtain data from any American data warehouse. Investigators often reach out to Google’s warehouse, for instance, to get a list of the devices that were active at the scene of a
                crime.
                <br> <br> Though many view such activity as an invasion of privacy, the U.S. has minimal privacy regulations. Even California’s radical new privacy law offers citizens no protections against government monitoring. In short, the government’s
                data well won’t run dry anytime soon. <br> <br>
