                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>Data scientists tackle questions about the future. They start with big data, characterized by the three V’s: volume, variety and velocity. Then, they use it as fodder for algorithms and models. The most cutting-edge data scientists, working
                    in machine learning and AI, make models that automatically self-improve, noting and learning from their mistakes.<br> <br> Data scientists have changed almost every industry. In medicine, their algorithms help predict patient side
                    effects. In sports, their models and metrics have redefined “athletic potential.” Data science has even tackled traffic, with route-optimizing models that capture typical rush hours and weekend lulls. </p>

            <h1>Examples</h1>
            <p>
                <b>HEALTH CARE </b> <br> <br> Back in 2008, data science made its first major mark on the health care industry. Google staffers discovered they could map flu outbreaks in real time by tracking location data on flu-related searches. The
                CDC's existing maps of documented flu cases, FluView, was updated only once a week. Google quickly rolled out a competing tool with more frequent updates: Google Flu Trends.<br> <br> But it didn’t work. In 2013, Google estimated about
                twice the flu cases that were actually observed. The tool’s secret methodology seemed to involve finding correlations between search term volume and flu cases. That meant the Flu Trends algorithm sometimes put too much stock in seasonal
                search terms like “high school basketball.” <br> <br> Even so, it demonstrated the serious potential of data science in health care. <br> <br>

                <b> ROAD TRAVEL  </b> <br> <br> Driving plays a central role in American life. The Supreme Court has called it “a virtual necessity,” and the vast majority of Americans — 86 percent — own or lease cars. In 2018, American automobiles burned
                more than 140 billion gallons of gasoline. In short, we love to drive. Unfortunately, this habit contributes to climate change. That’s where data science comes in. <br> <br> While both biking and public transit can curb driving-related
                emissions, data science can do the same by optimizing road routes. And though data-driven route adjustments are often small, they can help save thousands of gallons of gas when spread across hundreds of trips and vehicles — even among
                companies that aren’t explicitly eco-focused.<br> <br>


                <b> SPORTS</b> <br> <br> In the early 2000s, the Oakland Athletics’ recruitment budget was so small the team couldn’t recruit quality players. At least, they couldn’t recruit players any other teams considered quality. So the general manager
                redefined quality, using in-game statistics other teams ignored to predict player potential and assemble a strong team on the cheap.<br> <br> His strategy helped the A’s make the playoffs, and it snowballed from there. Author Michael Lewis
                wrote a book about the phenomenon, Moneyball, which spawned a film by the same name starring Brad Pitt. Today, there’s a $4.5-million global market for sports analytics. <br> <br>


                <b> GOVERNMENT</b> <br> <br> Though few think of the U.S. government as “extremely online,” its agencies can access more data than Google and Facebook combined. Not only do its agencies maintain their own databases of ID photos, fingerprints
                and phone activity, government agents can get warrants to obtain data from any American data warehouse. Investigators often reach out to Google’s warehouse, for instance, to get a list of the devices that were active at the scene of a
                crime.
                <br> <br> Though many view such activity as an invasion of privacy, the U.S. has minimal privacy regulations. Even California’s radical new privacy law offers citizens no protections against government monitoring. In short, the government’s
                data well won’t run dry anytime soon. <br> <br>

                <b> E-COMMERCE</b> <br> <br> Once upon a time, everyone in a given town shopped at the same mall: a physical place with some indoor fountains, a jewelry kiosk and probably a Body Shop. Today, though, citizens of that same town can each
                shop in their own personalized digital mall, also known as the internet. Online retailers often automatically tailor their web storefronts based on viewers’ data profiles. That can mean tweaking page layouts and customizing spotlighted
                products, among other things. Some stores may also adjust prices based on what consumers seem able to pay, a practice called personalized pricing. Even websites that sell nothing (not directly, anyway) feature personalized ads.<br> <br>

                <b> SOCIAL LIFE  </b> <br> <br> The rise of social networks has completely altered how people socialize. Romantic relationships unfold publicly on Venmo. Facebook engineers can rifle through users’ birthday party invite lists. Friendship,
                acquaintanceship and coworker-ship all leave extensive online data trails. <br> <br> Some argue that these trails — Facebook friend lists or LinkedIn connections — don’t mean much. Anthropologist Robin Dunbar, for instance, has found that
                people can maintain only about 150 casual connections at a time; cognitively, humans can’t handle much more than that. In Dunbar’s view, racking up more than 150 digital connections says little about a person's day-to-day social life.
                <br> <br> Catalogs of social network users’ most glancing acquaintances hold another kind of significance, though. Now that many relationships begin online, data about your social world impacts who you get to know next.<br> <br>
