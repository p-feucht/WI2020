            <p>Recently, our team of data consultants had an awesome opportunity to present to a class of future data scientists at Galvanize Seattle. One student who came to hear our talk was Rebecca Njeri. Below, she shares tips on how to design a Data
                Science project. </p>

                <h1>To Begin, Brainstorm Data Project Ideas</h1>
                <p>To begin your data science project, you will need an idea to work on. To get started, brainstorm possible ideas that might interest you. During this process, go as wide and as crazy as you can, don’t censor yourself. Once you have a few
                    ideas, you can narrow down to the most feasible/interesting idea. Keep a timeline with a To Do, In Progress, Completed and Parking section. Have a self-scrum(lol) each morning to see what you accomplished the previous day and set a
                    goal for the new day. It could also help to get a friend with whom to scrum and help you keep track of your metrics. Goals and metrics can help you hold yourself accountable and ensure that you actually follow through and get your
                    project done.</p>

            <h1>Business Understanding</h1>
            <p>What are the business needs you are trying to address? What are the objectives of the Data Science project? For example, if you are at a telecommunications company, that needs to retain its customers, can you build a model that predicts churn?
                Maybe you are interested in using live data to help better predict what coupons to offer what customers at the grocery store.

            <h1>Data Understanding</h1>
            <p>What kind of data is available to you? Is it stored in a relational or NoSQL database? How large is your data? Can it be stored and processed on your hard drive or will you need cloud services? Are the any confidentiality issues or NDAs involved
                if you are working in partnership with a company or organization? Can you find a new data set online that you could merge and increase your insights.

        <div class="contentBox">
            <h1>Data Preparation</h1>
            <p>This stage involves doing a little Exploratory Data Analysis and thinking about how your data will fit into the model that you have. Is the data in data types that are compatible with the model? Are there missing values or outliers? Are these
                naturally occurring discrepancies or errors that should be corrected before fitting the data into a model? Do you need to create dummy variables for categorical variables? Will you need all the variables in the data set are some dependent
                on each other?</p>
